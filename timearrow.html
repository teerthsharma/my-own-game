    It was developed in 1927 by the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington
    The arrow of time, also called time's arrow, 
    is the concept positing the "one-way direction" or "asymmetry" of time. 
    Entropy is one of the few quantities in the physical sciences that require a particular direction for time,
     sometimes called an arrow of time
     Much like temperature, despite being an abstract concept, everyone has an intuitive sense of the effects of entropy.
      For example, it is often very easy to tell the difference between a video being played forwards or backwards. 
      A video may depict a wood fire that melts a nearby ice block, played in reverse it would show that a puddle of water turned a cloud of smoke into unburnt wood and froze itself in the process.
       Surprisingly, in either case the vast majority of the laws of physics are not broken by these processes, a notable exception being the second law of thermodynamics.
        When a law of physics applies equally when time is reversed, it is said to show T-symmetry; in this case, entropy is what allows one to decide if the video described above is playing forwards or in reverse as intuitively we identify that only when played forwards the entropy of the scene is increasing.
      Because of the second law of thermodynamics, entropy prevents macroscopic processes showing T-symmetry.
