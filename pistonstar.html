    The Pistol Star is an extremely luminous blue hypergiant star,
     one of the most luminous and massive known in the Milky Way. 
     It is one of many massive young stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the Galactic Center region. 
     The star owes its name to the shape of the Pistol Nebula, which it illuminates.
      It is located approximately 25,000 light years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius. 
      The star has a large mass comparable to the V4998 Sagittarii and a luminosity 3.3 million times the Sun (Lâ˜‰). 
    It would be visible to the naked eye as a fourth magnitude star if it were not for the interstellar dust that completely hides it from view in visible light.
